# Exercise 4

1. Move the array of cars to index.js, and pass the array of cars as props into Car Tool.

2. Add the appropriate prop types and default props to the Car Tool component.

3. Create a new component named Tool Header. Tool Header will have the following HTML structure:

<header>
  <h1>Some Header</h1>
</header>

Replace the header in Color Tool and Car Tool with the new Tool Header component. Be sure to configure the needed props, default props, and prop types to make Tool Header reusable.

4. Ensure it works!
